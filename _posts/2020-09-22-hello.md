Who ever knows what to say when you start something like this? To that effect, I've started and abandoned these types of things more times than I can count. So, who's to say this'll even stick.

But, here it is. A blog&mdash;_my_ blog.

I reckon this is mostly because I'm sick of social media. Sick of the cesspool of vitriol it engenders. While at the same time, I got shit on my mind I need to put somewhere. Notebooks are fine, but generally my hand cramps from writing. Then comes the trying to find something I wrote down three months later. Hence the effort to go digital.

I read a lot. I write. I watch movies. I work in DevOps. And I think awfully long and hard about life, humanity, and what it all means.

Guess that gives you a task of what maybe to expect.
