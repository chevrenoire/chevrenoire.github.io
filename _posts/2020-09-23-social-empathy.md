>“Go to where you are kindest”  
>― **Jaron Lanier** _Ten Arguments For Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now_

I've had a long and grueling sort of love-hate relationship with social media; with web 2.0 in general. On the one hand, it's a marvel how we are all able to connect instantly, no matter where we live, to just about anyone we want to. On the other hand, it's been my observation that those connections are heavily one-sided, shaped by ulterior motives, and generally rob us of the time we'd spend connecting with those closest to us in the real world.

I recall the disappointment I felt on one of my milestone birthdays when the well wishes came to me via "_wall posts_" on Facebook instead of phone calls or even text. I found this to be lazy and uncaring&mdash;obviously my friends didn't intend that. I vowed that day to not be that guy, and to always reach out directly. Small things.

Since then I've completely deleted Facebook and refuse to be a part of it. In fact, I block it on my home network via [Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net/). I'm still on the fence with other platforms. I have an Instagram, but never use it. I do engage on Twitter, but it's starting to test my limits. Which brings me to the above quote&mdash;and book&mdash;by Jaron Lanier.

I've been reading his book. I've watched his talks and reads quotes from him before, but after seeing him on Netflx's [The Social Dilemma](https://www.netflix.com/title/81254224) I was compelled to finally grab and read his book. Much of the tech and motivations of said tech are things I already know and understand. But where I find myself most impacted by Lanier's plea for us to _delete our social media accounts_ is in regard to how we're being behaviorally modified by attention-starved algorithms.

Lanier goes to great lengths to make sound arguments against the use of these productivity suckholes, platforms he refers to as **BUMMER**&mdash;“_Behaviors of Users Modified and Made into an Empire for Rent_”&mdash;platforms. Two of my key takeaways thus far are that these platforms are "turning us into assholes" and similarly robbing us of ability to truly empathize with others.

I've felt it. I've experienced it. And over the last year or two, I've taken great strides to curtail my inner troll, to _not_ reply or engage, to just ignore negativity. But the impulse and the urge are always there. Because of that, social media is still on thin ice with me.

So, I chose the above quote as something to reflect on with regards to my time and attention. I always find the positive approach more successful and less of a head fuck than the negative. "_Go to where you are kindest_" feels as though it's a reward; whereas say, _avoid things that make you shitty_ kind of feels like you're going to miss out on something.

Read Jaron's book. Consider your relationship to social media.
