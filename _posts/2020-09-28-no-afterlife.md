They say if you don't want to make a stink steer away from religion and politics. Well, I'm here to make a stink.

I don't dare say that I'm so enlightened that I am in complete focus upon the _here and now_; however, I do focus on life. _This_ life. And in doing so, I cannot help but feel enraged and at times helpless against the seeming futility of my ability to affect change upon what I see as a lost and destructive culture of capitalistic greed. We don't even have to look to the elite to see atavistic greed's impact upon our land or our people. It's as if the ascent to becoming a _Have_ somehow divests one of the memories of the _Have-Not_.

Here in _'Merica_ where Capital is king, it's frustrating to see a society of indifference toward our most valuable of all shared assets; this planet. This is not exclusively an American issue, but the American experience is my experience and so I speak from that point of view. For decades industry has pillaged our land and people through politicized actions like eminent domain and strip mining. Forcing both people and wildlife out of their homes for the sake of short-term profits for a very few.

My slice of this country is often referred to as _The Bible Belt_ and for good reason. The populace of this region is easily manipulated by simple plays on their myopic and misunderstood theologies. Now, while I personally detest theistic religion, I concede that not all religious folk (here, predominantly Christian) are _bad_, just as not all Republicans are bad. In fact, almost certainly no person is _all bad_&mdash;nor all good for that matter. However, the Christian and the Republican have joined in a sort of political marriage here in the West. And behind closed doors, that marriage has brought in a poisonous bedfellow, _Big Oil_.

The Christian may not know about the liaison the Republican has with Industry, but I wager it's less the not knowing and more likely the not acknowledging. See, I can't speak for all sects of Christianity, but the evangelical south is all about saving face. The southern Christian will flat out deny any sort of scandal in order to maintain their social standing. 

Having conversations about conservation with these staunch _Believer_ types often engenders frustration. Many of my conversations with family (and some friends) of the Christian ilk ultimately devolves to their dismissal of "matters of this world" for the reason that their life is not here, but "_with Jesus_." Which is to say, we don't care about anyone's tomorrow here because our tomorrow is "_there_." So, basically, fuck us.

Spelling it out that way to a Christian would certainly send them into a fit of "why I nevers" as they clutch their pearls and back pedal and attempt to clarify their position. But the fact of the matter remains that most of these folks, again not bad people per se, live disconnected from this life experience because they believe in a promise of life ever after in some sort of heaven. 

That core value is poison.

On the surface it doesn't look bad. Hell, heaven may even sound like a nice place to some (though I argue the notion of lying at the feet of some space tyrant whose kingdom is lined with streets of gold sounds like a capitalist hell to me). The poison though is that ultimately this belief exonerates the believer from any sort of responsibility in ownership of this planet, it's temporary. Sabastian Junger in his book _Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging_ attributes littering (and fraudulent government assistance) to a lack of concern for one's community to a [feeling or sense of not belonging, of not having ownership](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7685121-in-this-sense-littering-is-an-exceedingly-petty-version-of).

So, the belief that one is "_not of this world_" absolves one of ownership of this world. And it fucking shows.

It is unanimously the Republican right that marches industry across land and home, raping earth and family and leaving utter devastation in its wake. Oh, and guess who foots the bill of repairing all that strip mined land and poisoned water? The tax payer; or: the fucking poor.

And how anyone with any moral compass can turn a blind eye to this is beyond me. How anyone can look at what Industry has left in its wake in places like West Virginia or western Kentucky, how the land and people have been reduced to husks, how anyone can acknowledge that morally corrupt dismissal of humanity and nature and wave it away with some pissant piety like "_I just have to let go and let God_" is utter fucking insanity to me.

And as this poison of evangelical ideology continues to creep itself into American politics, laws and legislation, we see more and more of this type of treatment of both human life and natural wildlife; indifference if not utter contempt. 

We watched the Patagonia film [_Public Trust_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGjnIG7puzY) last night, which is what stewed this sleeping rage inside of me. In that film, which I highly recommend, you'll see that the current modus operandi of the _Right_ via financial motivations of _Big Oil_ is to evangelize and politicize the renouncement of our Public Lands. With the promise of "trillions of dollars" and euphemisms like "energy independence," the notion is to rescind federal ownership Public Lands and turn that over to the states. Which ultimately means, the lands&mdash;or at the very least the mineral rights&mdash;will be sold post-haste to private companies whereupon they will be turned into dystopian oil mines, stripped completely of life and beauty.

But, hey...some folks get to go be with Jesus, so really who gives a fuck, right?
