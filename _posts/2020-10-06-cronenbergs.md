> â€œEverybody's a mad scientist, and life is their lab."  
> &mdash; David Cronenberg

As I've previously mentioned, we're running through a marathon of sixty-one horror movies that we started on September 1st. (that [list is here](https://letterboxd.com/writeknuckled/list/2020s-61-days-of-horror/).) We just recently completed the little section I affectionately refer to as _The Mind Fuck Films_: _Scanners_, _The Fury_, _Possessor_, and _Pontypool_.

I had seen _Scanners_ (multiple times) and _Pontypool_ before, but the other two were new to me, and _Possessor_ is new to all of us as it was released only this year. I was excited to add it in there along with _Scanners_ for obvious reasons; like father like son.

I have devoured most&mdash;if not all&mdash;of David Cronenberg's films, to which I would normally refer to as simply _Cronenberg_ films; however, with _Possessor_, Brandon Cronenberg has more than made himself a name, to which I believe going forward, we will have to clarify _which_ Cronenberg we are referring to.

_Possessor_ is beyond psychological, it's a neurological gore-fest thriller wrapped up in a frame signifying it to be a work of fine art. It is beautifully crafted in every capacity. Andrea Riseborough (_Mandy_) and Christopher Abbot (_It Comes at Night_) take lead in the film and both provide astounding performances. Karim Hussain's photography is stunning. And, Matthew Hannam slices like an iron chef. Literally, no one slouches on this film.

I've not seen Brandon's previous film, _Antiviral_, but I plan to rectify that immediately. I'm bewildered by the eight years that stand between that film and _Possessor_, and only hope that this indicates Brandon's commitment to craft being what kept him away from producing another film. If it's not clear, I am hungry for more from Brandon Cronenberg.

Meanwhile, I can't help but imagine&mdash;fantasize&mdash;about what it must've been like to grow up under the wing of David Cronenberg. To live in under the house rules of a man whose cinematic work is undoubtedly some of the most creative and interesting of the last several decades. What was that like? How did that influence&mdash;which it obviously has&mdash;Brandon? And how did it potentially encumber him?

I look at other brilliant creative, cinematic minds like my personal favorite, David Lynch, and his daughter, Jennifer Lynch, who has certainly made a career for herself, but has as of yet failed to make a _name_ for herself. Her film, _Surveillance_, bless its heart, bless _her_ heart, was an utter travesty. And so I wonder, what was the dynamic of the Cronenberg home which beget another profound voice in Brandon, where the Lynch home seems to have failed to pass on that unique gene?

Perhaps it's gross of me to ponder such things. Perhaps it's gross to even assume the child of a genius to even _want_ to follow in the path of creativity.

And, yet, it seems so often they do.

That said, _Possessor_ is an absolute **banger**. This is a must-see. And I cannot wait for it to get a proper release. Already pre-ordered on iTunes.
