2020 has been a strange year. Pretty much for all of us, I'd say. It's been a year that pushed most of us to live primarily indoors. It forced many of us into a more sedentary lifestyle. It took away from us things&mdash;and access to things&mdash;we took for granted. 

Things like the gym.

Now, if I'm being fair, I'd slacked off from the gym well before COVID-19 took it away from me.

Not going into the details, but our little world was thrown a bit upside down in early 2019. The events of that time led to a similar reclusion. Once the normalcy of that settled in, excuses weaseled their way in, and before you know it excuses brought their lousy son of a bitch friend, the enemy of health and productivity: Weakness.

Before long my evenings consisted of soft clothes and receding into the couch for hours with a tub of popcorn and a six-pack of beer.

That frivolously wasteful use of precious time perpetuated until I'd had enough...and then COVID hit.

That said, today marked the end of that bullshit.
