Last night was the first of the 2020 Presidential Debates.

And it was a shit show.

I have zero desire to dig into what was said&mdash;or more accurately, what was shouted over&mdash;last night, but instead I want to dig into how that _conversation_ played out and how it's a prime example of everything that's fucking wrong with our culture today. 

What we witnessed was a theatrical display of how it's virtually impossible for _Right_ and _Left_ to engage in civil discourse. Granted, the point of these debates isn't for the two candidates or parties to come align on issues or reach compromise, the point is to inform us what their position is on key talking matters. 

We didn't get that. We got a lot of speaking _at_ each other, not _to_ each other. 

When we look at this debate for what it is, our utmost example for political discourse today, we have to acknowledge it as problematic. And if you don't see that, you're part of the problem. You may want to visit one of those _sit-here-on-the-couch-and-tell-me-about-yourself_ kind of doctors. Pronto.

If the two men competing for leadership of this nation can't practice civil discourse, how on earth do we expect different from members of our community; from ourselves?

I have a theory. Now I know folks can get a little _tinfoil hat-y_ with their theories, but my theory is simply that we've allowed for the "_Fear of Otherness_" to settle into the bones of our culture so that every which way we turn, we willingly opt ourselves into smaller and smaller factions, further separating ourselves from each other.

We choose teams. 

Teams divide us.

And please correct me if I'm wrong, but I simply can't think of a sport or a game in which teams compete to share the victory.

While I'm not talking _actual_ sports here, sports fandom can lend some depressing examples of just how dangerous team alignment can be. Have you ever been to a tailgate at an SEC/ACC football game?

> **Story time**: I'm a Boston Red Sox fan. And, I lived in Manhattan for a handful of years. You see where this is going. I once rode the D train home from The Bronx after a Yankees/Red Sox game. I was razzed and ridiculed for one hundred and twenty seven city blocks. It was all in good fun. In fact, I was invited out for drinks with the group that was the loudest of the bunch. No big deal. Another night, standing outside the Barrow Street Ale House, a guy had to be restrained by his friends because he wanted to beat the living shit out of me...because I had on a Red Sox cap.  ![Red Sox/Yankeees fighting](/assets/images/redsoxyankees.jpg)

So again, not talking sports here, but the analogy works well in comparison with our social and cultural associations. Many of these "_teams_" we've become a part of are not by our choice, they were simply assigned to us. We don't choose where we're born or the color of our skin, or example. But many social associations we _do_ choose, or at least participate in the choosing. Our religion or lack thereof, our friends, our sports teams, and our political party or leanings for example.

Mindful people operate within these associations with some level of empathy, understanding, and acceptance of those outside of their group. We certainly may proffer playful jabs when our sports teams compete, but it's in good fun. Mindful people listen to and engage with opposing ideas&mdash;after all, it is said that ["_the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function_."](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/22749-before-i-go-on-with-this-short-history-let-me) But mindfulness of opposition and, more so, acceptance of opposition are seemingly rare qualities.

We are programmed to hate the _Other_.

All of our "teams" are important, if not to our social and cultural contracts, than very much to us individually. But it's this team-based mindset that closes the door on any notion of "_working across the aisle_," so to speak. Instead, we shut off our ears and turn up our mouths in our dealings with _Others_, when it's the opposite we should be doing&mdash;at least most of the time.

A bigger issue when it comes to matters of political discourse is that we've allowed far too much _personal_ liberty to be politicized. Our bodies, our races, our sexualities, our creeds, and other personal alignments have no place under scrutiny from anyone other than ourselves, let those of a governing body. Having allowed for these types of issues to become politicized has essentially shutdown any hope for resolute political discourse.

_Actual_ political matters can, and should, be debated. How tax dollars are collected and used. How we care for our planet. How we provide and maintain clean water to our people. How we feed and shelter our vets and our homeless. How we educate our children. How we provide and pay for higher education. How we maintain peace and protect ourselves. How we afford and obtain medical care. HOW WE CAN GET AWAY FROM BEING RUN INTO THE GROUND BY MONEY-HUNGRY CAPITALIST OVERLORDS. 

These are all political topics that, while we may not all agree upon the _whats_ and _hows_, what we can likely all agree upon is that they need solutions.

But, that would require our being on the same team. Instead, we've chosen&mdash;consciously or circumstantially&mdash;to be divided. Instead of _Us_, the people, you know from that often cited document, _The Constiution_), versus _Them_, those who've corrupted our government through, and via, financial gain, and so what we've allowed for is entropic interpersonal in-fighting.

We are simply spinning our wheels, screaming ourselves red in the face at one another.

Meanwhile, the real enemies of the state&mdash;_our_ real enemies&mdash; are out there buying themselves another yacht and masterminding sex trafficking multi-level marketing schemes (...an Epstein jab), or, more commonly, raping our land and people via dog-eared legislation, stripping both of everything valuable and leaving us fighting amongst ourselves in the wake of it all.

It's OK to disagree. It's OK to feel strongly about a thing. It's OK to strongly appose another thing. But it's also OK to chill the fuck out and listen to someone who feels a different way. It's OK not to react to that opposition with vitriol and violence.

We are robbing ourselves of the experience and insight of _Others_ by being so fucking belligerent in our stances that we can't shut the fuck up and listen to anyone who thinks differently.

This behavior is poisonous. We should all be mindful of this. And then we should all join together and stomp a massive fucking mudhole in the asses of these white collar criminal fucks who've stolen our land and government from us.

Or, something like that.
