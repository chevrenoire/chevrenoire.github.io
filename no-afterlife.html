            <blockquote>
  <p>“Being a Humanist means trying to behave decently without expectation of rewards or punishment after you are dead.”<br />
— Kurt Vonnegut</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They say if you don’t want to make a stink steer away from religion and politics. Well, I’m here to make a stink.</p>

<p>I don’t dare say that I’m so enlightened that I am in complete focus upon the <em>here and now</em>; however, I do focus on life. <em>This</em> life. And in doing so, I cannot help but feel enraged and at times helpless against the seeming futility of my ability to affect change upon what I see as a lost and destructive culture of capitalistic greed. We don’t even have to look to the elite to see atavistic greed’s impact upon our land or our people. It’s as if the ascent to becoming a <em>Have</em> somehow divests one of the memories of having been a <em>Have-Not</em>.</p>

<p>Here in <em>‘Merica</em>, where Capital is king, it’s frustrating to see a society of indifference toward our most valuable of all assets; human life (<em>once it’s vacated the womb, that is</em>) and this planet. This is not exclusively an American issue, I know that, but the American experience is my experience, and so I speak from that point of view. For decades industry has pillaged our land and people through politicized actions like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent_domain"><em>eminent domain</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_mining"><em>strip mining</em></a>. Forcing both people and wildlife out of their homes for the sake of short-term profits for a very few.</p>

<p>My slice of this country is often referred to as <em>The Bible Belt</em>, and for good reason. The populace of this region is easily manipulated by simple plays on their myopic and misunderstood theologies; hand-me-down rhetorics they can barely cite for themselves. While I personally detest theistic religion, I concede that not all religious folk (here, being predominantly Christian) are <em>bad</em>, just as not all Republicans are bad. In fact, almost certainly no person is <em>all bad</em>—nor all good for that matter. However, the Christian and the Republican have joined in a sort of political marriage here in the West. And behind closed doors, that marriage has invited in a poisonous bedfellow, <em>Big Industry</em>.</p>

<p>The Christian may not know about the liaison the Republican has with Industry, but I wager it’s less the not knowing and more likely the not acknowledging. See, I can’t speak for all sects of Christianity, but the evangelical south is all about saving face. The southern Christian will flat out deny any sort of scandal in order to maintain their social standing to the point of letting whatever that “scandal” may be ruin everything around them. They’ll participate in mental Olympics the likes of which could ensnare the cleverest minds by why of justifying something they know damn well to be morally wrong with some tenuous reference to their little holy book of vast interpretation.</p>

<p>Having conversations about humanity and conservation with these staunch <em>Believer</em> types often engenders frustration. Many of my conversations with family (and some friends) of the Christian ilk ultimately devolves to their dismissal of “matters of this world” for the reason that their life is not here, but “<em>with Jesus</em>.” Which is to say, we don’t care about anyone’s tomorrow “<em>here</em>” because our tomorrow is “<em>there</em>.”</p>

<p>So, basically, fuck us.</p>

<p>Spelling it out this way to a Christian will certainly send them into a fit of “why I nevers” as they clutch their pearls and back pedal in attempt to clarify their position. But the fact of the matter remains that most of these folks, again not bad people per se, live disconnected from this life experience because they believe in the promise of life ever after in some sort of heaven.</p>

<p>That core value is poison.</p>

<p>On the surface it may not <em>look</em> bad. Hell, heaven may even sound like a nice place to some, though I argue the notion of lying at the feet of a space tyrant whose kingdom is lined with streets of gold sounds far too much like a Capitalist hell to me, but to each their own. The poison, though, is that ultimately this belief exonerates the believer from any sense of responsibility of ownership on this planet; it’s temporary. Sabastian Junger in his book <em>Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging</em> attributes littering (and fraudulent government assistance) to a lack of concern for one’s community to a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7685121-in-this-sense-littering-is-an-exceedingly-petty-version-of">feeling or sense of not belonging, of not having ownership</a>.</p>

<p>So, the belief that one is “<em>not of this world</em>” absolves one of ownership in matters this world. <em>And it fucking shows</em>.</p>

<p>It is unanimously the Republican Right that marches industry across land and home, raping earth and family and leaving utter devastation in its wake. Oh, and guess who foots the bill of repairing all that strip-mined land and poisoned water? The tax payer; or: the fucking poor to be exact.</p>

<p>How anyone with any moral compass can turn a blind eye to this is beyond me. How anyone can look at what Industry has left in its wake in places like West Virginia or western Kentucky, how the land and people have been reduced to husks, how this is happening now in Alaska, how it’s actively in planning stages to happen in our national forests, how anyone can acknowledge that morally bankrupt dismissal of humanity and nature, and wave it away with some pissant piety like “<em>I just have to let go and let God</em>” is utter fucking insanity to me.</p>

<p>And yet that very <em>utter fucking insanity</em> appears to account for about half of our voting populace. So, as the poison of evangelical ideology continues to creep itself into American politics, laws, and legislation, we see more and more of this mistreatment of human life—and natural wildlife—transpire with indifference, if not utter contempt, for both.</p>

<p>We watched the Patagonia film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGjnIG7puzY"><em>Public Trust</em></a> last night, which is what stewed this sleeping rage inside of me. In that film, which I highly recommend, you’ll see that the current modus operandi of the <em>Right</em>, via financial motivations of <em>Big Industry</em>, is to evangelize and politicize the renouncement of our Public Lands. With the promise of “trillions of dollars” and euphemisms like “energy independence,” the plan of these evil fucks is to rescind federal ownership of Public Lands and turn them over to the states, which ultimately means, the lands—or at the very least the mineral rights—will be sold post-haste to private companies whereupon they will be turned into dystopian oil mines, stripped completely of life and beauty and left for bare. Left for the growing lower class to foot the bill of repair.</p>

<p>But, hey…some folks get to go be with Jesus, so really who gives a fuck, right?</p>
