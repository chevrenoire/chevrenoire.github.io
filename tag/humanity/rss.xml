  <p>“The government itself, which is only the mode which the people have chosen to execute their will, is equally liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it.”
— Henry David Thoreau; <em>Civil Disobedience</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Welp.</p>

<p>Did we really expect any different from this election?</p>

<p>I certainly didn’t. And yet, I’m still dismayed.</p>

<p>This country and this government are a duet performing an utter shit show for the world to gasp—or laugh—at.</p>

<p>But this isn’t a joke.</p>

<p>America is seeing itself divided in the worst possible way. This division isn’t a division of party. This is a division of humanity. Goddamn near half of this country stands in favor of a party—and a man—that support and stir racism, misogyny, and growing socioeconomic class division. Stand in favor of is too light a phrase…they fucking champion this shit.</p>

<p>And the rest of us? We are utterly flummoxed.</p>

<p>This trend of a divided country does not support healthy growth of any kind. And, it cannot stand.</p>

<p>Because as it stands, we are stuck.</p>

<p>It’s frustrating to see this unfold and it’s absolutely soul-crushing to feel powerless against what looks and feels like the de-evolution of our country, counties, cities, towns, communities, and even families.</p>

<p>But. Giving up isn’t an option. Vigilance is necessary.</p>

<p>I don’t care where anyone stands or who they “like,” evil interests are working against all of our best interests. We need now, more than ever, to figure out how to get on the same page with each other. I don’t have the <em>how’s</em>, nor do I have any real answers. I just know it’s imperative we don’t let these crony fucks destroy us in the process of destroying our country.</p>

<p>And, if you’re out there seeing these numbers rolling in and you’re feeling increasingly marginalized or scared or under-valued, please know that’s not true. You are important. You matter. And your are needed.</p>

<p>Stay safe out there.</p>

	  <title>That Whole Hillbilly Elegy Thing</title>

	     <p>For those of us that knew it was coming, yesterday it came: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW_3aaoSOYg">Netflix released their trailer for <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em></a>. And, it looks a bit more atrocious than I expected.</p>

<p>For those not in the know, you’re probably seeing this all over your social media feed and wondering what the hell for. <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em> came to life first as a memoir by one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance">J.D. Vance</a>, where it spent an absurd amount of time on the New York Times Top Ten list. The book hit shelves at a crucial time: after the election of Donald Trump as president.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/elegyBook.jpg" alt="Hillbilly Elegy by J.D. Vance" /></p>

<p>Perhaps that was by design. For if this book had just been a memoir about one guy’s experience growing up poor and white, with some honestly entertaining anecdotes about his grandmother—<em>Mawmaw</em>—then perhaps it would have done just fine, and most likely we wouldn’t be having these ongoing conversations about it four years later. There likely wouldn’t be a film directed by Oscar winning filmmaker, Ron Howard, and starring Oscar darlings, Glenn Close and Amy Adams.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/elegyMovie.jpg" alt="Glenn Close and Amy Adams in _Hillbilly Elegy_" /></p>

<p>Yet here we are still talking about it, four years later. We’re talking about it so much so that folks are damn near making a living by doing so. Many books and essays have been written in response. And there’s an incredibly fun and insightful podcast, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-972848621-463073718">The Trillbilly Worker’s Party</a>, that got its start by critically responding to the book.</p>

<p>So, what is it about <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em> that’s got us all in a stir?</p>

<p>There’s a lot wrong with this book. I’ll start with: instead of being one man’s memoir about one man’s experience, Vance positions his book as “<em>A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis</em>.” Instead of <em>his</em> experience and <em>his</em> family’s struggles and reasons for <em>their</em> beliefs and <em>their</em> handlings of <em>their</em> goings-on, he makes wide assertions about the <em>whole</em>  of Appalachia. It’s not J.D. Vance’s experience, it’s the Appalachian experience.</p>

<p>And it’s that assertion as fact that has led to this book becoming the “answer” to the question so many people were—and still are—asking; how the fuck did Donald Trump get elected as president?</p>

<p>The real problem is: J.D. Vance’s singular experience is absolutely not the shared experience of Appalachia. No one’s singular experience is ever that.</p>

<p>Furthermore is the assumption that Appalachia is composed entirely of poor white working-class folk. It’s not. Appalachia is exceptionally well-diversified.</p>

<p>And then there’s the question: what, and where,is Appalachia?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is where I diverge from much of the critical commentary. Yes, absolutely, the Appalachian Mountains are a vast range that extends north to south across many states and even into Canada. But, let’s be honest here, no one in New York state refers to themselves as Appalachian. We all know what region we are speaking of. And, even in parceling out that area for discourse, those hills and hollers of Eastern Kentucky, Tennessee, Western North Carolina, Virginia, the whole of West Virginia, and pieces of Pennsylvania, even then we still maintain a cornucopia of diversity. The hemming and hawing over how much ground and how many people the Appalachian Mountains encompass in the general discourse of what’s ultimately wrong about these generalized and white-washed perspectives on this region is a bit tired and lazy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Within this region, Vance makes sweeping assertions about family, faith, politics, desires, motivations, and so much more. Be it by design or by ignorance, Vance furthers the negatives of White appropriation by disassociating the collective culture and voice of the many for that of his own.</p>

<p>Perhaps most disturbing is that Vance essentially victim-blames the region for their plight. It’s their fault for not seeking higher education. It’s their fault for not seeking to better themselves. It’s their fault that meth and opioids have swept the hills and hollers in staggering numbers in comparison to other parts of this country. Certainly crony Capitalism, in its avarice and machinanations, sweeping those hilltops for decades, stripping the land of resource, poisoning the waters and earth with its detritus, working its men and women to the bone, and when the resources are all gone, gathering up their companies and jobs, and up and leaving the people behind, tired, unemployed, and in pain with little to hold in their hands but the fucking bill had absolutely nothing to do with the plight of Appalachia.</p>

<p>But mostly, it’s their fault for not leaving.</p>

<p>But, then again, Vance is now a Yale graduate and Venture Capitalist who’s left his home behind in his attempts to further Capitalism, while seemingly doing little beyond shake a finger at his home and call it out for being lazy and backwards. So, why would we expect his opinion to be any different? He’s living Ayn Rand’s dream.</p>

<p>The problem with the book is that people read the book and they think, “ah, ok, this is how <em>poor white trash</em> think and operate,” and they build or bolster prejudice toward an entire region based upon that. People look at Appalachia and think it’s beyond help. Its people are stubborn and stupid and reaping what they’ve sown. And while certainly people like Vance’s family exist in that region—they exist in all regions—those people don’t compose that region. And thusly the entire region suffers further.</p>

<p>The people of Appalachia deserve better. They’re not a people to be gawked at via poverty porn vehicles like <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em>, or to be judged from the perspectives of one man. No person or regian deserves that.</p>

<p>Certainly there is crisis in Appalachia, but it’s not the crisis of lazy indignation. It’s the crisis of Industry having raped and pillaged the land and people to the point of exhaustion. The plight of Appalachia isn’t the byproduct of ignorant, lazy, drug-addicted and well-fare trickstery denizens. The plight of Appalachia is Capitalism. And in that regard Appalachia is no different than Detroit.</p>

<p>If you want to know more about the realities of Appalachia, there’s far better options than <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em>. Here’s a few:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-972848621-463073718">Trilbilly Worker’s Party Podcast</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/what-you-are-getting-wrong-about-appalachia-none/9780998904146">What You are Getting Wrong About Appalachia</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/appalachian-reckoning-a-region-responds-to-hillbilly-elegy/9781946684790?aid=185&amp;listref=appalachia-as-depicted-by-appalachians">Appalachian Reckoning</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://bittersoutherner.com/hillbillies-need-no-elegy-appalachian-reckoning">The Bitter Southerner</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074605/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2">Harlan County, USA</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Or, <em>and this may be a stretch</em>, but go visit this region. Go hike its mountains. Visit its towns. Talk to its people. Spend a few dollars there. We can learn a lot about things online, but I’m still a sucker for good ol’ life experience.</p>

<p>As for <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em>, the film, while its trailer smacks of poverty porn, I’m hoping that it takes a more singular view. I’m hoping the notion of one man speaking for many is removed from the film and we just get the story of a family and their trials and triumphs as they may be. But, we’ll just have to wait and see on that.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, if you’re going to support something Appalachian, let it be anything but <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em>, please.</p>

	     <blockquote>
  <p>“People are clustered into paranoia peer groups because then they can be more easily and predictably swayed.” <br />
— Jaron Lanier</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Last night was the first of the 2020 Presidential Debates.</p>

<p>And it was a shit show.</p>

<p>I have zero desire to dig into what was said—or more accurately, what was shouted over—last night, but instead I want to dig into how that <em>conversation</em> played out and how it’s a prime example of everything that’s fucking wrong with our culture today.</p>

<p>What we witnessed was a theatrical display of how it’s virtually impossible for <em>Right</em> and <em>Left</em> to engage in civil discourse. Granted, the point of these debates isn’t for the two candidates or parties to align on issues or reach compromise. The point is to inform us, the voting public, what their position is on key issues.</p>

<p>We didn’t get that. We got a lot of speaking <em>at</em> each other, not <em>to</em> each other. Frankly, what we got was even worse than that.</p>

<p>When we look at this debate for what it is, our utmost example for political discourse today, we have to acknowledge it as problematic. And if you don’t see it that way, you’re part of the problem. You may want to visit one of those <em>sit-here-on-the-couch-and-tell-me-about-yourself</em> kind of doctors. Pronto.</p>

<p>If the two men competing for leadership of this nation can’t practice civil discourse, how on earth do we expect different from members of our community; from ourselves?</p>

<p>I have a theory. Now I know folks can get a little <em>tinfoil hat-y</em> with their theories, but my theory is simply that we’ve allowed for the “<em>Fear of Otherness</em>” to settle into the bones of our culture so that every which way we turn, we willingly opt ourselves into smaller and smaller factions, further separating ourselves from each other.</p>

<p>We choose teams.</p>

<p>And teams divide us.</p>

<p>While I’m not talking sports here, sports fandom can do well to lend some depressing examples of just how dangerous team alignment can be. I mean, have you ever been to a tailgate at an SEC/ACC football game? And, soccer hooligans? Those were (perhaps still are) a thing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Story time</strong>: I’m a Boston Red Sox fan. And, I lived in Manhattan for a handful of years. You see where this is going. I once rode the D train home from The Bronx after a Yankees/Red Sox game. I was razzed and ridiculed for one hundred and twenty seven city blocks. It was all in good fun. In fact, I was invited out for drinks with the group that was the loudest of the bunch. No big deal.</p>

  <p>However, another night, standing outside the Barrow Street Ale House, a guy had to be restrained by his friends because he wanted to beat the living shit out of me…because I had on a Red Sox cap.  <img src="/assets/images/redsoxyankees.jpg" alt="Red Sox/Yankeees fighting" /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So again, not talking sports here, but the analogy works well in comparison with our social and cultural associations. Many of these “<em>teams</em>” we’ve become a part of are not by our design. They were simply assigned to us. We don’t choose where we’re born or the color of our skin, for example. But many social associations we <em>do</em> choose, or at least participate in the choosing. Our religion or lack thereof, our friends, our sports teams, and our political party or leanings, for example.</p>

<p>Mindful people operate within these associations with some level of empathy, understanding, and acceptance of those outside of their group. We certainly may proffer playful jabs when our sports teams compete, but it’s in good fun. Mindful people listen to and engage with opposing ideas—after all, it is said that <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/22749-before-i-go-on-with-this-short-history-let-me">“<em>the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function</em>.”</a> But mindfulness of opposition and, more so, acceptance of opposition are seemingly rare qualities.</p>

<p>We are programmed to hate the <em>Other</em>.</p>

<p>In his book, <em>Shop Class as Soulcraft</em>, which I highly recommend, Matthew B. Crawford admonishes the common trend among “<em>thought work</em>“—or office-type—workers to create and promote teams and teamwork. Again, he lands on the notion that teams are innately in opposition to one another. Instead of teams, what Crawford suggests, and provides as an example, regarding different groups working together to achieve a singular goal is the concept of <em>crews</em>. If we look at the construction of a new building, which is easy for me as my town is under constant construction, you’ll see many unique crews, landscaping, electrical, structural, flooring, roofiing, etc. working together toward the end product of a functioning office or apartment building.</p>

<p>Crews may not always agree, and they may actually even dislike one another, but the work drives forward on an agreed upon outcome.</p>

<p>Unlike teams.</p>

<p>A bigger issue when it comes to matters of political discourse, and perhaps why we are so team-minded, is that we’ve allowed far too much <em>personal</em> liberty to be politicized. Our bodies, our races, our sexualities, our creeds, and other personal alignments have no place under scrutiny from anyone other than ourselves, let alone a governing body. Having allowed for these types of issues to become politicized, to separate us, has essentially shutdown any hope for resolute political discourse.</p>

<p><em>Actual</em> political matters can, and should, be debated, and I firmly believe middle ground can be found. How tax dollars are collected and used. How we care for our planet. How we maintain and provide clean water to our people. How we feed and shelter our vets and our homeless. How we educate our children. How we provide and pay for higher education. How we maintain peace and protect ourselves. How we afford and obtain medical care. HOW WE CAN GET AWAY FROM BEING RUN INTO THE GROUND BY MONEY-HUNGRY CAPITALIST OVERLORDS…I digress</p>

<p>These are all political topics that, while we may not all agree upon the <em>whats</em> and <em>hows</em>, what we can likely all agree upon is that they need solutions.</p>

<p>To solve these problems would require our being on the same team—or at least working together as a crew. Instead, we’ve chosen—consciously or circumstantially—to be divided. Instead of <em>Us</em>, the people, you know from that often cited document, <em>The Constitution</em>), versus <em>Them</em>, those who’ve corrupted our government through, and via, financial gain, and so what we’ve allowed for is entropic interpersonal in-fighting.</p>

<p>We are simply spinning our wheels, screaming ourselves red in the face at one another.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the real enemies of the state—<em>our</em> mutual enemies— are out there buying themselves another yacht and masterminding sex trafficking multi-level marketing schemes (…an Epstein jab), or, more commonly, raping our land and people via dog-eared legislation, stripping both of everything valuable and leaving us fighting amongst ourselves in the wake of it all.</p>

<p>It’s OK to disagree. It’s OK to feel strongly about a thing. It’s OK to strongly oppose another thing. But it’s also OK to chill the fuck out and listen to someone who feels a different way. It’s OK not to react to that opposition with vitriol and violence.</p>

<p>We are robbing ourselves of the experience and insight of <em>Others</em> by being so fucking belligerent in our stances that we can’t shut the fuck up and listen to anyone who thinks differently.</p>

<p>This behavior is poisonous. We should all be mindful of this. And then we should all join together and stomp a massive fucking mudhole in the asses of these white collar criminal fucks who’ve stolen our land and government from us.</p>

<p>Or, something like that.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I believe that there will ultimately be a clash between the oppressed and those that do the oppressing. I believe that there will be a clash between those who want freedom, justice and equality for everyone and those who want to continue the systems of exploitation.”<br />
— Malcolm X</p>
