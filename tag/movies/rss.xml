  <p>“Other writers, producers, and directors of low-budget films would often put down the film they were making, saying it was just something to make money with. I never felt that. If I took the assignment, I’d give it my best shot.”<br />
— Roger Corman</p>

<p>I don’t know what makes a <em>bad</em> movie <em>great</em>, but I love a lot of absolutely shitty movies, and I think they’re all amazing.</p>

<p>I grew up watching VHS horror flicks. I was raised on Jason, Freddy, Michael and Leatherface. I saw absolutely every one of their sequels throughout the 80’s and 90’s, as well as their 00’s remakes.  I saw <em>Faces of Death</em> and <em>I Spit on Your Grave</em>. I don’t know why, but I was allowed to see a lot of movies a child should not see.</p>

<p>Many of these films burrowed their mark deep inside my impressionable young mind and remain absolute favorites of mine, to this day, despite being <em>objectively</em> not good movies. One of which I recently sought out on Blu Ray, <em>Slaughterhouse Rock</em>…really bad, but fuck…I love it.</p>

<p>As a kid, and into my teens, I devoured every title in the horror section of my Pick-A-Flick. Eventually the home rental market started to die and gave rise to the whole DVD home ownership market. To say that I embraced this would be an understatement.</p>

<p>I took a long break from the home vide market. But as of late, I’ve fallen right back into stride. In doing so, I don’t find myself seeking out the latest and greatest from the Hollywood machine, I find myself scouring for the best version of those nefarious titles that graced the shelves at my local video stores.</p>

<p>And thankfully due to companies like <a href="https://vinegarsyndrome.com">Vinegar Syndrom</a>, <a href="https://severin-films.com/">Severin Films</a>, <a href="https://www.synapsefilms.com/">Synapse Films</a>, <a href="https://www.codereddvd.com/">Code Red</a>, <a href="http://massacrevideo.com/">Massacre Video</a>, and many others…these otherwise forgotten films are being meticulously revived, restored, and made available to us today.</p>

<p>At this very moment, I’m watching Vinegar Syndrome’s release of the absolutely terrible—and amazing—<em>Spookies</em>, and I can’t help but pine for the days in which these god-awful VHS gems proliferated.</p>

<p>Sure, I love truly <em>fine</em> filmmaking. I love <em>cinema</em>.</p>

<p>But goddamnit, <em>shitty</em> movies forever have a home in my heart. And, I wish more of us loved them.</p>

<p>I want to sit amongst a gathering of many and laugh at the absurdity—and utter bravery—of films like <em>Blood Games</em>, <em>Psychos In Love</em>, <em>Nekromantik</em>, and <em>Body Melt</em>. These movies deserve audiences, are best experienced with others. And yet, without the likes of these daring distribution companies, most of these titles would be utterly lost to us.</p>

<p>I am ever so grateful for the men and women working behind the scenes of these companies, and so many others than I failed to cite—and perhaps, sadly don’t even know exist. You are truly doing the best work in cinema today, you are keeping alive these amazingly terrible movies.</p>

<p>You are doing Lucifer’s work.</p>

<p>And, when COVID finally becomes a shadow in our collective existence, I’ll gather with a few close friends and we’ll watch the <em>Severin Films</em> release of Lucio Fulci’s “<em>The Devil’s Honey</em>”.</p>

<p>After that, we’ll watch the upcoming 4K UHD release of <em>Dial Code Santa Claus</em> from <em>Vinegar Syndrome</em>.</p>
