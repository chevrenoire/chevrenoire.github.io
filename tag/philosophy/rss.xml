  <p>“Until you make the unconscious conscious,<br />
it will direct your life<br />
and you will call it fate.”<br />
— Carl Jung</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aimlessness’s only outcome is entropy.</p>

<p>Opting out of consciously directing our lives does not in turn opt us out of the overall <em>Game of Life</em>. Life continues around us with or without our active participation. No one gets to be an NPC in Life. You’re either directing your thoughts, energy, and actions or someone/thing else is.</p>

<p>Of every tool at our disposal, the mind is by far the most powerful. Unlike other tools, however, the mind is always on and always active. Therefore, we must monitor and maintain our mind and our thoughts. Otherwise, myriad others are working tirelessly to take ownership of your thoughts.</p>

<p>We are being constantly sold things. Every minute of every day. Our minds are under constant attack via advertising, technology, and even our friends. All of which are vying for our time and attention and hoping to rewire our desires and impulses.</p>

<p>It’s a lot easier to see when we are being sold a <em>thing</em>. When the goal of the mental hijacker is to drive us toward a real-world purshase. My better half calls it “<em>being Gramboozled</em>.” We’re flicking our screens all day and seeing these things we don’t have and the creatives behind the ads and the technology understand how to associate these things to reward centers in our minds. Whether we know it or not, we are being programmed to feel like we need these things.</p>

<p>It’s not always just stuff. Nor is it just advertisers. Sometimes the goal is just to keep us in competition, driving each other to appear <em>better than</em>. Sometimes it us. <em>We</em> are actively contributing to the endless <em>FOMO</em> cycle. Think of how most of us curate our online lives to appear as exciting and happy as they possibly can. We share our highlight reels with the world. Meanwhile, we’re looking at each others’ feeds and comparing their highlights, not to our highlights, but to our regular ass, mundane real-world situations.</p>

<p>I’m over here paying bills and developing IBS while ol’ <em>so-and-so</em> is posting pics from the beach; nevermind that we <em>think</em> we saw those same pics last year—beacuse they are from last year. We <em>know</em> that, but we’re allowing our mind to feel left out and less than.</p>

<p>And it’s that kind of thinking that spirals us into <a href="https://deviljames.com/rubbernecking"><em>mental rubbernecking and eventual collisions</em></a>.</p>

<p>We’ve allowed the machinations of someone—person or entity—to guide our thinking. And whomever controls the thought, controls the action.</p>

<p>We have to get into the driver’s seat of our own lives; our own minds.</p>

<p>Otherwise, who knows where we’re headed. But, I can’t imagine it’s where any of us wanted to go.</p>

  <p>“Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.”<br />
— Bruce Lee</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those of us who drive, be it out of necessity or convenience, have most certainly encountered our fair share of traffic jams, or worse, traffic accidents.</p>

<p>Highways are vast networks of concrete and asphalt which allow for a fantastical number of person-carrying vehicles to travel upon. The mind is a lot like a highway system, and our thoughts are a lot like the cars traveling along those neural lanes. The thing about highways is there are a number of “rules of the road” for which anyone operating a vehicle is supposed to abide. We operate as drivers on the road with a certain shared faith in one another that these rules will be observed and we reciprocate by ourselves observing the same rules. Failure on anyone’s part to do so often results in traffic buildup, travel delays, or worse, human fatalities.</p>

<p>These traffic snafus are further exacerbated by fucking rubberneckers.</p>

<p>So, there’s a wreck or a car is pulled over on the side of the road. It seems like an innocent thing, the desire to glance over at what’s going on. Let me just get a peek. Nothing about having seen the wreck will benefit your travels in the least, but you must know, you have to see it. And so does the person behind you, and the person behind them, and the person behind them, and so on and so on, so that three miles back people are gripping their steering wheels in a seething rage because they’re going to be late to work.</p>

<p>The mind is similar.</p>

<p>Our mind generates thoughts at incalculable rates. The mind is like the 405 at peak traffic. (If you’ve driven in Los Angeles, you know what this means. If not, everything you’ve heard about driving in Los Angeles is far more true than you can possibly imagine.) Even concerted effort would fail at trying to chase every thought we produce. The flip side of that is that one doesn’t even have to actively think to find oneself lost in thought.</p>

<p>Obviously not all thoughts are problematic. Many thoughts lead us toward myriad positive results. We think about and solve a problem in our job. We think about what we want to eat and we feed ourselves. We think about someone we love and we surprise them, in turn making them happy. Positive thoughts typically beget progress. And progress is always the point.</p>

<p>It’s the negative thoughts that trap us. These thoughts and the rubbernecking thoughts they engender are what stymy our progress. So, as our mind trucks along, spit-balling thoughts at us constantly, we can find ourselves either moving forward, <em>in the flow</em>, or we find ourselves in a <em>thought accident</em>, rubbernecking, and now entangled in a traffic jam of absolutely useless thinking.</p>

<p>I’ll never be a good writer. It took me asking my girlfriend to help me remember the word <em>entitlement</em>. For fuck’s sake. I’m an idiot. Look at me…an absolute fucking moron. Ew. Holy shit. <em>Look</em> at me. Is this what I look like? Why is my face so stupid looking? Why the fuck are there hairs in my ears? Why doesn’t anyone tell me I have hairs in my ears?! Obviously, no one tells me because everyone enjoys secretly mocking me. Everyone hates me. And look at this pandemic gut I’ve put on. I’ll never lose this weight. I’ll probably die of diabetes. Or maybe a lions will attack me. Are there lions here in the south? There could be lions here if the zoo lost funding and a disgruntled zookeeper just happened to not lock the cages one night. Then there would be lions. Or, bears. Bears actually live here. Holy fuck…what if sharks could breathe? Fucking great whites walking around on land? But I guess they couldn’t walk, so they’d what, flop around? Still, even if they flopped around, land sharks would definitely kill us all. I’d be first to go. And, I wouldn’t get to apologize to that lady I didn’t hold the door for at the gas station that time in Joshua Tree. I know she still thinks about that. Cursing the day I was born. That’s it! She cursed me. She was a fucking witch, and I didn’t hold the door because I was, fuck what was I doing? So that’s why sharks will learn to breathe and fucking eat us all. Do we have milk? I should probably go get milk.</p>

<p>That’s how negative thinking works. We let one negative thought get our attention and then the rest of our thoughts rubberneck around to the point that we’re stuck, doing absolutely nothing but making ourselves miserable with meaningless non-existences.</p>

<p>Being mindful is the hardest easiest thing to be. Driving is a good example of when we are mindful. We’re present. We’re observing the rules of the road and operating our vehicle safely, <strong>not</strong> driving in the goddamn left lane which is for passing only. For fuck’s sake, who taught you how to drive!? if you’re going to drive slow—meaning <em>less</em> than ten miles over the speed limit—then move your nowhere-going ass over to the right lane…and goddamn it, there I go again; rubbernecking.</p>

<p>Mindfulness is when we’re in a flow. We’re operating without influencing our operation. Like Bruce Lee says, “like water.” In the mindful state, we find our “way around or through” whatever it is we’re coming up against, which is most often ourselves.</p>

<p>However, mindfulness isn’t a one-and-done. Mindfulness is an <em>always</em> practice. The goal isn’t to attain some state. Our mind isn’t a destination. It’s a journey. Alan Watts said, ““To travel is to be alive, but to get somewhere is to be dead.”</p>

<p>Maybe someone out there has achieved perfect mindfulness. I doubt it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nana korobi,<br />
ya oki</p>

  <p>Fall down seven times,<br />
stand up eight times.<br />
— Japanese proverb</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m certainly still on the path of falling down and getting up again. I’ve accepted that. And that’s made the journey all the more enjoyable; all the more experiential.</p>

<p>Join me.</p>
