  <p>“The government itself, which is only the mode which the people have chosen to execute their will, is equally liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it.”
— Henry David Thoreau; <em>Civil Disobedience</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Welp.</p>

<p>Did we really expect any different from this election?</p>

<p>I certainly didn’t. And yet, I’m still dismayed.</p>

<p>This country and this government are a duet performing an utter shit show for the world to gasp—or laugh—at.</p>

<p>But this isn’t a joke.</p>

<p>America is seeing itself divided in the worst possible way. This division isn’t a division of party. This is a division of humanity. Goddamn near half of this country stands in favor of a party—and a man—that support and stir racism, misogyny, and growing socioeconomic class division. Stand in favor of is too light a phrase…they fucking champion this shit.</p>

<p>And the rest of us? We are utterly flummoxed.</p>

<p>This trend of a divided country does not support healthy growth of any kind. And, it cannot stand.</p>

<p>Because as it stands, we are stuck.</p>

<p>It’s frustrating to see this unfold and it’s absolutely soul-crushing to feel powerless against what looks and feels like the de-evolution of our country, counties, cities, towns, communities, and even families.</p>

<p>But. Giving up isn’t an option. Vigilance is necessary.</p>

<p>I don’t care where anyone stands or who they “like,” evil interests are working against all of our best interests. We need now, more than ever, to figure out how to get on the same page with each other. I don’t have the <em>how’s</em>, nor do I have any real answers. I just know it’s imperative we don’t let these crony fucks destroy us in the process of destroying our country.</p>

<p>And, if you’re out there seeing these numbers rolling in and you’re feeling increasingly marginalized or scared or under-valued, please know that’s not true. You are important. You matter. And your are needed.</p>

<p>Stay safe out there.</p>

	     <blockquote>
  <p>“People are clustered into paranoia peer groups because then they can be more easily and predictably swayed.” <br />
— Jaron Lanier</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Last night was the first of the 2020 Presidential Debates.</p>

<p>And it was a shit show.</p>

<p>I have zero desire to dig into what was said—or more accurately, what was shouted over—last night, but instead I want to dig into how that <em>conversation</em> played out and how it’s a prime example of everything that’s fucking wrong with our culture today.</p>

<p>What we witnessed was a theatrical display of how it’s virtually impossible for <em>Right</em> and <em>Left</em> to engage in civil discourse. Granted, the point of these debates isn’t for the two candidates or parties to align on issues or reach compromise. The point is to inform us, the voting public, what their position is on key issues.</p>

<p>We didn’t get that. We got a lot of speaking <em>at</em> each other, not <em>to</em> each other. Frankly, what we got was even worse than that.</p>

<p>When we look at this debate for what it is, our utmost example for political discourse today, we have to acknowledge it as problematic. And if you don’t see it that way, you’re part of the problem. You may want to visit one of those <em>sit-here-on-the-couch-and-tell-me-about-yourself</em> kind of doctors. Pronto.</p>

<p>If the two men competing for leadership of this nation can’t practice civil discourse, how on earth do we expect different from members of our community; from ourselves?</p>

<p>I have a theory. Now I know folks can get a little <em>tinfoil hat-y</em> with their theories, but my theory is simply that we’ve allowed for the “<em>Fear of Otherness</em>” to settle into the bones of our culture so that every which way we turn, we willingly opt ourselves into smaller and smaller factions, further separating ourselves from each other.</p>

<p>We choose teams.</p>

<p>And teams divide us.</p>

<p>While I’m not talking sports here, sports fandom can do well to lend some depressing examples of just how dangerous team alignment can be. I mean, have you ever been to a tailgate at an SEC/ACC football game? And, soccer hooligans? Those were (perhaps still are) a thing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Story time</strong>: I’m a Boston Red Sox fan. And, I lived in Manhattan for a handful of years. You see where this is going. I once rode the D train home from The Bronx after a Yankees/Red Sox game. I was razzed and ridiculed for one hundred and twenty seven city blocks. It was all in good fun. In fact, I was invited out for drinks with the group that was the loudest of the bunch. No big deal.</p>

  <p>However, another night, standing outside the Barrow Street Ale House, a guy had to be restrained by his friends because he wanted to beat the living shit out of me…because I had on a Red Sox cap.  <img src="/assets/images/redsoxyankees.jpg" alt="Red Sox/Yankeees fighting" /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So again, not talking sports here, but the analogy works well in comparison with our social and cultural associations. Many of these “<em>teams</em>” we’ve become a part of are not by our design. They were simply assigned to us. We don’t choose where we’re born or the color of our skin, for example. But many social associations we <em>do</em> choose, or at least participate in the choosing. Our religion or lack thereof, our friends, our sports teams, and our political party or leanings, for example.</p>

<p>Mindful people operate within these associations with some level of empathy, understanding, and acceptance of those outside of their group. We certainly may proffer playful jabs when our sports teams compete, but it’s in good fun. Mindful people listen to and engage with opposing ideas—after all, it is said that <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/22749-before-i-go-on-with-this-short-history-let-me">“<em>the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function</em>.”</a> But mindfulness of opposition and, more so, acceptance of opposition are seemingly rare qualities.</p>

<p>We are programmed to hate the <em>Other</em>.</p>

<p>In his book, <em>Shop Class as Soulcraft</em>, which I highly recommend, Matthew B. Crawford admonishes the common trend among “<em>thought work</em>“—or office-type—workers to create and promote teams and teamwork. Again, he lands on the notion that teams are innately in opposition to one another. Instead of teams, what Crawford suggests, and provides as an example, regarding different groups working together to achieve a singular goal is the concept of <em>crews</em>. If we look at the construction of a new building, which is easy for me as my town is under constant construction, you’ll see many unique crews, landscaping, electrical, structural, flooring, roofiing, etc. working together toward the end product of a functioning office or apartment building.</p>

<p>Crews may not always agree, and they may actually even dislike one another, but the work drives forward on an agreed upon outcome.</p>

<p>Unlike teams.</p>

<p>A bigger issue when it comes to matters of political discourse, and perhaps why we are so team-minded, is that we’ve allowed far too much <em>personal</em> liberty to be politicized. Our bodies, our races, our sexualities, our creeds, and other personal alignments have no place under scrutiny from anyone other than ourselves, let alone a governing body. Having allowed for these types of issues to become politicized, to separate us, has essentially shutdown any hope for resolute political discourse.</p>

<p><em>Actual</em> political matters can, and should, be debated, and I firmly believe middle ground can be found. How tax dollars are collected and used. How we care for our planet. How we maintain and provide clean water to our people. How we feed and shelter our vets and our homeless. How we educate our children. How we provide and pay for higher education. How we maintain peace and protect ourselves. How we afford and obtain medical care. HOW WE CAN GET AWAY FROM BEING RUN INTO THE GROUND BY MONEY-HUNGRY CAPITALIST OVERLORDS…I digress</p>

<p>These are all political topics that, while we may not all agree upon the <em>whats</em> and <em>hows</em>, what we can likely all agree upon is that they need solutions.</p>

<p>To solve these problems would require our being on the same team—or at least working together as a crew. Instead, we’ve chosen—consciously or circumstantially—to be divided. Instead of <em>Us</em>, the people, you know from that often cited document, <em>The Constitution</em>), versus <em>Them</em>, those who’ve corrupted our government through, and via, financial gain, and so what we’ve allowed for is entropic interpersonal in-fighting.</p>

<p>We are simply spinning our wheels, screaming ourselves red in the face at one another.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the real enemies of the state—<em>our</em> mutual enemies— are out there buying themselves another yacht and masterminding sex trafficking multi-level marketing schemes (…an Epstein jab), or, more commonly, raping our land and people via dog-eared legislation, stripping both of everything valuable and leaving us fighting amongst ourselves in the wake of it all.</p>

<p>It’s OK to disagree. It’s OK to feel strongly about a thing. It’s OK to strongly oppose another thing. But it’s also OK to chill the fuck out and listen to someone who feels a different way. It’s OK not to react to that opposition with vitriol and violence.</p>

<p>We are robbing ourselves of the experience and insight of <em>Others</em> by being so fucking belligerent in our stances that we can’t shut the fuck up and listen to anyone who thinks differently.</p>

<p>This behavior is poisonous. We should all be mindful of this. And then we should all join together and stomp a massive fucking mudhole in the asses of these white collar criminal fucks who’ve stolen our land and government from us.</p>

<p>Or, something like that.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I believe that there will ultimately be a clash between the oppressed and those that do the oppressing. I believe that there will be a clash between those who want freedom, justice and equality for everyone and those who want to continue the systems of exploitation.”<br />
— Malcolm X</p>

	     <blockquote>
  <p>“Being a Humanist means trying to behave decently without expectation of rewards or punishment after you are dead.”<br />
— Kurt Vonnegut</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They say if you don’t want to make a stink steer away from religion and politics. Well, I’m here to make a stink.</p>

<p>I don’t dare say that I’m so enlightened that I am in complete focus upon the <em>here and now</em>; however, I do focus on life. <em>This</em> life. And in doing so, I cannot help but feel enraged and at times helpless against the seeming futility of my ability to affect change upon what I see as a lost and destructive culture of capitalistic greed. We don’t even have to look to the elite to see atavistic greed’s impact upon our land or our people. It’s as if the ascent to becoming a <em>Have</em> somehow divests one of the memories of having been a <em>Have-Not</em>.</p>

<p>Here in <em>‘Merica</em>, where Capital is king, it’s frustrating to see a society of indifference toward our most valuable of all assets; human life (<em>once it’s vacated the womb, that is</em>) and this planet. This is not exclusively an American issue, I know that, but the American experience is my experience, and so I speak from that point of view. For decades industry has pillaged our land and people through politicized actions like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent_domain"><em>eminent domain</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_mining"><em>strip mining</em></a>. Forcing both people and wildlife out of their homes for the sake of short-term profits for a very few.</p>

<p>My slice of this country is often referred to as <em>The Bible Belt</em>, and for good reason. The populace of this region is easily manipulated by simple plays on their myopic and misunderstood theologies; hand-me-down rhetorics they can barely cite for themselves. While I personally detest theistic religion, I concede that not all religious folk (here, being predominantly Christian) are <em>bad</em>, just as not all Republicans are bad. In fact, almost certainly no person is <em>all bad</em>—nor all good for that matter. However, the Christian and the Republican have joined in a sort of political marriage here in the West. And behind closed doors, that marriage has invited in a poisonous bedfellow, <em>Big Industry</em>.</p>

<p>The Christian may not know about the liaison the Republican has with Industry, but I wager it’s less the not knowing and more likely the not acknowledging. See, I can’t speak for all sects of Christianity, but the evangelical south is all about saving face. The southern Christian will flat out deny any sort of scandal in order to maintain their social standing to the point of letting whatever that “scandal” may be ruin everything around them. They’ll participate in mental Olympics the likes of which could ensnare the cleverest minds by why of justifying something they know damn well to be morally wrong with some tenuous reference to their little holy book of vast interpretation.</p>

<p>Having conversations about humanity and conservation with these staunch <em>Believer</em> types often engenders frustration. Many of my conversations with family (and some friends) of the Christian ilk ultimately devolves to their dismissal of “matters of this world” for the reason that their life is not here, but “<em>with Jesus</em>.” Which is to say, we don’t care about anyone’s tomorrow “<em>here</em>” because our tomorrow is “<em>there</em>.”</p>

<p>So, basically, fuck us.</p>

<p>Spelling it out this way to a Christian will certainly send them into a fit of “why I nevers” as they clutch their pearls and back pedal in attempt to clarify their position. But the fact of the matter remains that most of these folks, again not bad people per se, live disconnected from this life experience because they believe in the promise of life ever after in some sort of heaven.</p>

<p>That core value is poison.</p>

<p>On the surface it may not <em>look</em> bad. Hell, heaven may even sound like a nice place to some, though I argue the notion of lying at the feet of a space tyrant whose kingdom is lined with streets of gold sounds far too much like a Capitalist hell to me, but to each their own. The poison, though, is that ultimately this belief exonerates the believer from any sense of responsibility of ownership on this planet; it’s temporary. Sabastian Junger in his book <em>Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging</em> attributes littering (and fraudulent government assistance) to a lack of concern for one’s community to a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7685121-in-this-sense-littering-is-an-exceedingly-petty-version-of">feeling or sense of not belonging, of not having ownership</a>.</p>

<p>So, the belief that one is “<em>not of this world</em>” absolves one of ownership in matters this world. <em>And it fucking shows</em>.</p>

<p>It is unanimously the Republican Right that marches industry across land and home, raping earth and family and leaving utter devastation in its wake. Oh, and guess who foots the bill of repairing all that strip-mined land and poisoned water? The tax payer; or: the fucking poor to be exact.</p>

<p>How anyone with any moral compass can turn a blind eye to this is beyond me. How anyone can look at what Industry has left in its wake in places like West Virginia or western Kentucky, how the land and people have been reduced to husks, how this is happening now in Alaska, how it’s actively in planning stages to happen in our national forests, how anyone can acknowledge that morally bankrupt dismissal of humanity and nature, and wave it away with some pissant piety like “<em>I just have to let go and let God</em>” is utter fucking insanity to me.</p>

<p>And yet that very <em>utter fucking insanity</em> appears to account for about half of our voting populace. So, as the poison of evangelical ideology continues to creep itself into American politics, laws, and legislation, we see more and more of this mistreatment of human life—and natural wildlife—transpire with indifference, if not utter contempt, for both.</p>

<p>We watched the Patagonia film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGjnIG7puzY"><em>Public Trust</em></a> last night, which is what stewed this sleeping rage inside of me. In that film, which I highly recommend, you’ll see that the current modus operandi of the <em>Right</em>, via financial motivations of <em>Big Industry</em>, is to evangelize and politicize the renouncement of our Public Lands. With the promise of “trillions of dollars” and euphemisms like “energy independence,” the plan of these evil fucks is to rescind federal ownership of Public Lands and turn them over to the states, which ultimately means, the lands—or at the very least the mineral rights—will be sold post-haste to private companies whereupon they will be turned into dystopian oil mines, stripped completely of life and beauty and left for bare. Left for the growing lower class to foot the bill of repair.</p>

<p>But, hey…some folks get to go be with Jesus, so really who gives a fuck, right?</p>
