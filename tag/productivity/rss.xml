  <p>“You’ve never lived what you are thinking, and that isn’t good. Only the ideas we actually live are of any value.”<br />
— Hermann Hesse <em>Demian</em></p>

<p>2020 has been a strange year. Pretty much for all of us, I’d say. It’s been a year that pushed most of us to live primarily indoors. It forced many of us into a more sedentary lifestyle. It took away from us things—and access to things—we took for granted.</p>

<p>Things like the gym.</p>

<p>Now, if I’m being fair, I’d slacked off from the gym well before COVID-19 took it away from me.</p>

<p>Not going into the details, but our little world was thrown a bit upside down in early 2019. The events of that time led to a similar reclusion. Once the normalcy of that settled in, excuses weaseled their way in, and before you know it excuses brought their lousy son of a bitch friend, the enemy of health and productivity: Weakness.</p>

<p>Before long my evenings consisted of soft clothes and receding into the couch for hours with a tub of popcorn and a six-pack of beer.</p>

<p>That frivolously wasteful use of precious time perpetuated until I’d had enough…and then COVID hit.</p>

<p>That said, today marked the end of that bullshit.</p>
